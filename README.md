This is a mini online Etch-A-Sketch app that allows one to draw on the "sketchpad" by hovering their cursor over it. The buttons provided allow for changing pen thickness, switching between default (grey ink) and RGB (psychedelic ink), and clearing the sketchpad, respectively.<br/>

This project utilizes the usual HTML/CSS for the UI and lots of JavaScript for a dynamic, functional application. Through this project I was also able to get in more practice with DOM manipuation, which I was still not confident with at the time of starting work on the application, but through much research and trial and error, I'm proud to say I feel more comfortable with it.<br/>

Known issues:
-Selecting RGB then clearing sketchpad defaults ink back to regular
-RGB button appearing as selected despite not actually being selected as a result of first issue
